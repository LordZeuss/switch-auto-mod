Automatically download necessary files and configure the SD card.


## Stay tuned for a proper guide/README file soon. 
This project is extremely fresh and new. Functional, but not the way I want it yet! Will be updating this soon.

**This script will give the option of formatting an SD card, and will download move any and all files in their correct places for you. It also adds quality of life things such as sigpatches and such for potential errors.**

Stay tuned!

## Usage
Run the python script, or download the EXE release.

If you use the EXE, you may have to disable windows defender. I used pyinstaller to convert the py to an EXE, and windows has a trojan false positive (not sure why. May have to change the way the exe works). Run the python script if you prefer. You will need python installed to do so.
